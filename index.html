                <p>Turtles are reptiles Turtles belong to the reptile class, Reptilia. They are closely related to snakes, crocodiles, and alligators. Turtles are found all over the world, in oceans, lakes, rivers, and forests.</p>
                <p>Turtles have shells Turtles are known for their hard shells. The shell is made up of two parts: the carapace (top shell) and the plastron (bottom shell). The shell is fused to the turtle's spine and ribs, and it protects the turtle from predators.</p>
                <p>Turtles are cold-blooded Turtles are cold-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature depends on the temperature of their surroundings. When it is cold outside, turtles will sunbathe to warm up. When it is hot outside, turtles will seek shade to cool down.</p>
                <p>Turtles are omnivores Turtles are omnivores, which means that they eat both plants and animals. Different species of turtles have different diets. Some turtles eat fish, insects, and worms. Other turtles eat algae, grasses, and fruits.</p>
